    "PEP 8, sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write Python code that conforms to PEP 8\n",
    "- Understand the reasoning behind the guidelines laid out in PEP 8\n",
    "- Set up your development environment so that you can start writing PEP 8 compliant Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why We Need PEP 8\n",
    "\n",
    "- PEP 8 exists to improve the readability of Python code\n",
    "- But why is readability so important? Why is writing readable code one of the guiding principles of the Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "- As Guido van Rossum said, “Code is read much more often than it is written.” \n",
    "- You may spend a few minutes, or a whole day, writing a piece of code to process user authentication\n",
    "- Once you’ve written it, you’re never going to write it again\n",
    "- But you’ll definitely have to read it again. That piece of code might remain part of a project you’re working on\n",
    "- Every time you go back to that file, you’ll have to remember what that code does and why you wrote it, so readability matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you’re new to Python, it can be difficult to remember what a piece of code does a few days, or weeks, after you wrote it\n",
    "- If you follow PEP 8, you can be sure that you’ve named your variables well\n",
    "- You’ll know that you’ve added enough whitespace so it’s easier to follow logical steps in your code\n",
    "- You’ll also have commented your code well. All this will mean your code is more readable and easier to come back to. As a beginner, following the rules of PEP 8 can make learning Python a much more pleasant task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Following PEP 8 is particularly important if you’re looking for a development job\n",
    "- Writing clear, readable code shows professionalism\n",
    "- It’ll tell an employer that you understand how to structure your code well\n",
    "\n",
    "# Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you write Python code, you have to name a lot of things: variables, functions, classes, packages, and so on\n",
    "- Choosing sensible names will save you time and energy later\n",
    "- You’ll be able to figure out, from the name, what a certain variable, function, or class represents\n",
    "- You’ll also avoid using inappropriate names that might result in errors that are difficult to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Never use l, O, or I single letter names as these can be mistaken for 1 and 0, depending on typeface:**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Naming Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "Function - Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores to improve readability \n",
    "Eg., function, my_function\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable - Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability\n",
    "Eg., x, var, my_variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Class - Start each word with a capital letter. Do not separate words with underscores. This style is called camel case\n",
    "Eg., Model, MyClass\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to Choose Names\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing names for your variables, functions, classes, and so forth can be challenging\n",
    "- You should put a fair amount of thought into your naming choices when writing code as it will make your code more readable\n",
    "- The best way to name your objects in Python is to use descriptive names to make it clear what the object represents\n",
    "\n",
    "- When naming variables, you may be tempted to choose simple, single-letter lowercase names, like x\n",
    "- But, unless you’re using x as the argument of a mathematical function, it’s not clear what x represents"
