###################Example Code#######################
a = 1
while a < 20:
    print(a)
    a = a * 2
else: # Optional
    print('While loop execution is stopped as the condition became false')
*Perform step by step flow for the above code*

An example to the step by step flow of the code and the output is given below, the same is expected as the result from you. 

#################Example Step by step flow####################
--> a is initilized to 1
--> in while loop we are checking a is smaller than 20 which returns true, so 1 will be printed.
--> now value of a become 1*2 =2
--> now 2 is again less than 20 , it returns true , so 2 will be printed.
--> now value of a become  2*2 =4
--> 4 is again less than 20 , so while loop returns true, so 4 will be printed.
--> a become 4*2 =8
--> 8 < 20 ==> true ==> 8 will print
--> a is now 16
--> in while loop 16 < 20 --> returns true
-->16 will going to print 
--> Now a =16*2 =32
--> 32 is not less than 20 --> returns false
go to else ==> statement print

*Example output*
1
2
4
8
16
While loop execution is stopped as the condition became false'
