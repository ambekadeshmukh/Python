    "# Python Multithreading\n",
    "- Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching)\n",
    "- Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes\n",
    "- Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application\n",
    "\n",
    "# Benefits of Multithreading in Python\n",
    "Following are the benefits to create a multithreaded application in Python, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It ensures effective utilization of computer system resources\n",
    "- Multithreaded applications are more responsive\n",
    "- It shares resources and its state with sub-threads (child) which makes it more economical\n",
    "- It saves time by executing multiple threads at the same time.\n",
    "- The system does not require too much memory to store multiple threads"
