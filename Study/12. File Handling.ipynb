    "# File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files\n",
    "- The concept of file handling has stretched over various other languages, but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy, but alike other concepts of Python, this concept here is also easy and short\n",
    " - Each line of code includes a sequence of characters and they form text file\n",
    " - Each line of a file is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} or newline character\n",
    "\n",
    "# Working of open() function\n",
    "\n",
    " - We use open() function in Python to open a file in read or write mode\n",
    " - To return a file object we use open() function along with two arguments, that accepts file name and the mode, whether to read or write\n",
    " - So, the syntax being: **open(filename, mode)**. There are three kinds of mode, that Python provides and how files can be opened:\n",
    "\n",
    " *** “ r “, for reading - Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n",
    "  \n",
    " *** “ w “, for writing - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    " \n",
    " *** “ a “, for appending -  Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    " \n",
    " *** “ r+ “, for both reading and writing\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " - One must keep in mind that the mode argument is not mandatory\n",
    " - If not passed, then Python will assume it to be “ r ” by default\n",
    " - Let’s look at this program and try to analyze how the read mode works:"
